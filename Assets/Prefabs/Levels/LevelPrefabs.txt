# DreamCraft: Puzzle Journey Level Design Guidelines

This document outlines the level design approach for creating dream worlds in DreamCraft.

## Level Structure
Each level should include:
1. A clear starting area with introductory dialogue
2. 2-4 interconnected puzzles that build upon each other
3. Key story choice moments
4. A visually distinct dreamscape environment matching the level theme
5. Optional hidden collectibles that reveal dream memories

## Level Themes & Puzzle Focus

### Level 1: Childhood Dream (Tutorial)
- **Visuals**: Nostalgic, warm-colored childhood home with slightly surreal proportions
- **Puzzles**: Simple object manipulation puzzles to teach basic interaction
- **Powers**: Introduction to resize power
- **Story**: Introduction to the dream world and initial choice that shapes your path

### Level 2: Ocean Depths
- **Visuals**: Underwater city with bioluminescent elements and floating bubbles
- **Puzzles**: Gravity/buoyancy puzzles, flow-based mechanics
- **Powers**: Introduction to gravity manipulation
- **Story**: Discover more about your dream guide's identity

### Level 3: Floating Islands
- **Visuals**: Surreal islands floating in a colorful sky with impossible geometry
- **Puzzles**: Perspective puzzles, path creation challenges
- **Powers**: Combined use of resize and gravity powers
- **Story**: Major choice affecting the dream world's stability

### Level 4: Clockwork Dream
- **Visuals**: Steampunk-inspired mechanical world with gears and pistons
- **Puzzles**: Timing-based challenges, synchronization puzzles
- **Powers**: Introduction to time manipulation
- **Story**: Discovering the connection between dreams and reality

### Level 5: Forest of Memories
- **Visuals**: Constantly shifting forest environment with symbolic elements
- **Puzzles**: Complex multi-stage puzzles combining all previous mechanics
- **Powers**: All powers used together in creative ways
- **Story**: Culmination of previous choices, revealing different endings

## Puzzle Design Guidelines

1. Each puzzle should have multiple valid approaches
2. Incorporate dream-like logic that challenges real-world expectations
3. Visual cues should hint at solutions (glowing objects, color schemes)
4. Include a "breakthrough moment" where players have an "aha!" realization
5. Puzzles should relate thematically to the dream environment

## Story Integration

1. Place story triggers at key moments (puzzle completion, area discovery)
2. Environmental storytelling should reinforce the narrative theme
3. Dream symbols should appear consistently across levels (recurring motifs)
4. Player choices should visibly affect the dream world appearance

## Level Building Requirements

- Use modular components for easy iteration
- Implement navmesh for player and NPC movement
- Add particle effects for dream-like atmosphere
- Create custom shader effects for each level theme
- Ensure mobile performance optimization
